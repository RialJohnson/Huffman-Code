# Huffman-Code
Lab #1 for CSCI 232 at Montana State University

This program takes in a "code message" String from a text file.

The program then compresses the message via a "Huffman encoding" technique using a tree-based priority queue. 
The encoded message will be stored in the optimal number of bits using 0s and 1s. 
The program will also decode the message, back to it's original readable String form.
